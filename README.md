# ECHELON-2 Clinical Decision Dashboard

An evidence-based clinical decision support tool for peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) treatment selection, risk assessment, and PET response prediction based on the ECHELON-2 trial data.

## Overview

This interactive dashboard provides clinicians with comprehensive tools for PTCL patient management, including:

- **Risk Stratification**: IPI and PIT prognostic model calculators with validated survival data
- **PET Response Prediction**: PET4 response prediction based on treatment arm, histology, and clinical parameters
- **Treatment Outcomes**: Evidence-based outcome predictions comparing A+CHP vs CHOP
- **Trial Results**: Complete ECHELON-2 statistical analysis with hazard ratios and significance testing
- **Clinical Analytics**: Patient demographics and subtype-specific outcome visualizations

## Features

### Risk Assessment
- Toggle between IPI (International Prognostic Index) and PIT (Prognostic Index for PTCL-U) models
- Real-time risk calculation with validated PTCL survival data
- Evidence-based prognostic categorization with 5-year and 10-year survival estimates

### PET Response Prediction
- Interactive PET4 response prediction incorporating:
  - Treatment arm selection (A+CHP vs CHOP)
  - Histological subtype (sALCL ALK+/ALK-, AITL, PTCL-NOS)
  - Baseline SUVmax values
  - Tumor bulk assessment
- Visual representation of predicted Deauville scores
- Prognostic impact analysis showing 38-45 percentage point survival differences

### Treatment Decision Support
- Subtype-specific outcome predictions
- Comparative efficacy analysis between treatment regimens
- Statistical significance testing with p-values and confidence intervals

### Key Clinical Findings
- 30% reduction in progression risk with A+CHP vs CHOP (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.53-0.91)
- 28% reduction in death risk (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.53-0.99)
- Significant benefit in sALCL patients, especially ALK+ subtype
- PET4-negative patients show substantially better outcomes regardless of treatment

## Usage

### For Clinicians
1. **Risk Assessment**: Input patient characteristics to calculate IPI or PIT scores with prognostic estimates
2. **Treatment Planning**: Use histology-specific outcome predictions to guide therapy selection
3. **PET Interpretation**: Predict PET4 response probabilities and understand prognostic implications
4. **Patient Counseling**: Access evidence-based survival data for informed consent discussions

### Technical Requirements
- Modern web browser with JavaScript enabled
- No installation required - runs entirely in browser
- Responsive design compatible with desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

## Data Sources

All calculations and predictions are based on peer-reviewed clinical trial data:
- ECHELON-2 trial (N=452 patients)
- Multinational, randomized, double-blind phase 3 study
- 5-year follow-up data with mature survival endpoints
- PET4 response analysis from recent Blood Advances publication

## Limitations

- Predictions based on clinical trial populations which may not represent all real-world patients
- AITL patients showed limited benefit and should be counseled accordingly
- Individual patient outcomes may vary from population-based predictions
- Tool intended for clinical decision support, not replacement of clinical judgment
